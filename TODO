CollisionTable - pass a const& for entity when moving


TODO cleaner angled-movement - when you press them quickly enough, you will get moved in the angled direction
TODO a simple combat log, show komunikat/errmsg/stuff

TODO sort sidelist of visible enemies

TODO mouse, convert to level-coordinates

TODO AI: move towards player (partly done - has functionality to follow, but AI not yet set)



IDEA rhythm - maybe if you press the movement key at the right moment, you can move faster or something?


spells:
1. hit enemies around yourself
2. hit enemies around target(fireball)
