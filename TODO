TODO ensure rewards get placed somewhere if there is a reward on the current tile

TODO always display the target, on top of the stack of monsters
TODO mouse-spell: let's say that id=0 at vector of active abilities will be the mouse spell

Features I want to have before I consider this a "release candidate":
✓1. generate new enemies during play
2. generate new obstacles during play
3. enemies that follow the player more smartly
✓5. implement ability: aoe damage around self
✓6. implement ability: aoe damage around target


TODO  add a warning when standing on a pendinglevelfeature: "Beware! the dungeon is forming in this spot."

FIXME stacked entities which have collision seem to be unable to un-stack themselves


Then, further complexity:
1. pick map size
2. pick map type(cave/maze)
3. levels, skills
4. player inventory, weapon/armor/consumables
5. some simple save/load system for persistent state
6. abilities: buffs
7. ressurect
8. "town" or something separate from the combat dungeon, where you can 


✓ IDEA optimization: only allow let's say 100 or 20 updates per second, so the level or timer will stack up on seconds before updating

IDEA penalty to ranged damage after moving
IDEA shift+digit("!@#$") perform a stronger version of spell which consumes more stacks

use CollisionTable
CollisionTable - pass a const& for entity when moving
CollisionTable - fix the debug display with huge maps

TODO deal damage to entities out-of-bounds
DONE double wait time after moving on angle
TODO show feedback that enemy out of range

TODO stop persistent movement when you try to go in the other way
TODO show something on the border of map
IDEA wraparound: go to y=y_max, get teleported to y=0
TODO make enemies wander slowly by default - random seconds of delay before they move in a random direction
TODO destroy corpses
TODO eat corpses



IDEA create new obstacles during gameplay: with a shadow '.' before spawning, and then create terrain
TODO generate random enemies during game

TODO items/inventory
TODO level up


TODO stop non-colliders from stacking up on one tile


TODO cleaner angled-movement - when you press them quickly enough, you will get moved in the angled direction
TODO a simple combat log, show komunikat/errmsg/stuff

TODO sort sidelist of visible enemies

TODO mouse, convert to level-coordinates




IDEA rhythm - maybe if you press the movement key at the right moment, you can move faster or something?


spells:
1. hit enemies around yourself
2. hit enemies around target(fireball)
3. create obstacle
4. destroy obstacle
5. buff: increased speed and no collision with walls


I was thinking about making the SFX for attack spells show briefly on, but that won't be needed - there is already feedback that something was hit :)

around 1000 entities the game starts slowing down, and at 2k it gets really slow




IDEA achievement/conduct: "purity of keys" - disabled mouse
