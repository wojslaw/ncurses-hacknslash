TODO ability 
TODO lifebar on the side of game window? oh I know - like with ability! next to life on the bottom

IDEA penalty to ranged damage after moving
IDEA shift+digit("!@#$") perform a stronger version of spell which consumes more stacks

use CollisionTable
CollisionTable - pass a const& for entity when moving
CollisionTable - fix the debug display with huge maps

TODO deal damage to entities out-of-bounds
DONE double wait time after moving on angle
TODO show feedback that enemy out of range

TODO stop persistent movement when you try to go in the other way
TODO show something on the border of map
IDEA wraparound: go to y=y_max, get teleported to y=0
TODO make enemies wander slowly by default - random seconds of delay before they move in a random direction
TODO destroy corpses
TODO eat corpses



IDEA create new obstacles during gameplay: with a shadow '.' before spawning, and then create terrain
TODO generate random enemies during game

TODO items/inventory
TODO level up


TODO stop non-colliders from stacking up on one tile


TODO cleaner angled-movement - when you press them quickly enough, you will get moved in the angled direction
TODO a simple combat log, show komunikat/errmsg/stuff

TODO sort sidelist of visible enemies

TODO mouse, convert to level-coordinates




IDEA rhythm - maybe if you press the movement key at the right moment, you can move faster or something?


spells:
1. hit enemies around yourself
2. hit enemies around target(fireball)
3. create obstacle
4. destroy obstacle
5. buff: increased speed and no collision with walls


I was thinking about making the SFX for attack spells show briefly on, but that won't be needed - there is already feedback that something was hit :)
